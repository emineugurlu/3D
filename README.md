🚀 Interactive Bee Animation with Three.js
In this project, I created a dynamic bee animation using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics. The bee model used in the animation was sourced from Skarfect and was animated through JavaScript to simulate movement and flight.

The project leverages modern HTML, CSS, and Three.js to provide an interactive, visually stunning user experience. By utilizing the full capabilities of Three.js, the bee moves smoothly within a 3D environment, responding to user interactions and creating a highly engaging animation. The animation demonstrates how 3D graphics and web technologies can be combined to enhance user experience in an immersive way.
